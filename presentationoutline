# NEW NOTES: (week 13)

rocket component: will

       - bedtime


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

drone component: whipples

      - present the acceleration magnitude data. explain what the numbers mean, their components, magnitude, and sign

      - what is the coordinate basis of the drone? that is, how is it oriented? (our up/down, what variable is it for the drone? what about our left/right? when you say "our", what are you taking the direction with respect to? (hint: video))

      - use the recorded video, from beto's phone, as a reference in the presentation. compare with our acceleration data, both component-wise and magnitude-wise

      - what application problems can you solve, using this understanding of the acceleration sensor? what possible challenges do you propose that you can try to solve using this sensor?

      - what challenges did you come across building the drone? (will can help with this, ask him, or our associates quang and vu. some problems include: center of mass, soldering/connectivity issues, controller-linking and calibration)

      - for future builds and flights, what improvements do you propose? why do you propose them? (accuracy, precision, applicability in real-life problems)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

technology component (electric motor): beto

	   - what is an electric motor?
	   - where did we use it for this class?
	   - what do the arrows represent on the motor?
	   - how fast can it spin?
	   - How does this motor work?
	   
	   - why do we use this type of motor instead of other motors for this particular drone-model that we built?
	   - what is the history behind this electric motor?
	   - why is this an important piece of the drone?
	   - what sort of other devices use this motor, and why? why is this technology so popular with many devices?

# these notes below here are the previous notes that I typed in class, it pretty much says the same stuff, but broader; i'm just including this so you guys have access to it as well, just in case

# OLD NOTES: (week 12)





# 3 components: rocket, drone, technology (electric motor, of the drone)

# - beto: electric motor, will: drone, whipples: rocket

# data(for all 3 comps):
	 why it looks the way it does, interpret the numbers

# rocket component:
       how to build it, science behind the rocket, challenges behind building rocket,

# discuss:
	what can we do with the equipment, how we can model the data that it receives considering idealized situations with perfect data, answer 'what question can i answer?')

	ie: why use the magnetic, temperature, etc sensors? what can we use these for? (applications)

# terminology:
  engineering: using a science question to optimize a human-related task
  scientific question: to answer 'why does x phenomenon occur?, we obtain data from engineering concepts


# additional info:
  audience: dean, mr. vaca, possibly more
  presentation day: may 18th
	     take the presentation seriously, 
	     dress businesss casual
